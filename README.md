Very simple examples for working with the Twitter API.

## Hints:
1. Use supervisord to manage execution. http://supervisord.org/
2. Use logrotate to manage archiving/compression. http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html
3. To process and look at Tweets, use jq. https://stedolan.github.io/jq/
